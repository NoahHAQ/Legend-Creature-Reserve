                <p><span>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.</span><span> The unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin.</span></p>
                <p><span>In European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk is a legendary reptile reputed to be a serpent king, who can cause death with a single glance.</span><span> According to the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, the basilisk of Cyrene is a small snake, "being not more than twelve fingers in length", that is so venomous, it leaves a wide trail of deadly venom in its wake, and its gaze is likewise lethal.</span></p>
                <p><span>The manticore or mantichore (Latin: mantich≈çra) is a Persian legendary creature similar to the Egyptian sphinx that proliferated in western European medieval art as well.</span><span> It has the head of a human, the body of a lion and a tail of venomous spines similar to porcupine quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a scorpion. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator.</span></p>
                <p><span>The fable of the Lamb of Tartary is represented as springing from a seed like that of a melon, but rounder, and supposedly cultivated by natives of the country where it grew.</span><span> The lamb was contained within the fruit or seedcapsule of the plant, which would burst open when ripe to reveal the little lamb within it. The wool of this little lamb was described as being "very white."</span></p>
